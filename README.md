# R-code-for-Delta-Method
This repository contains R code for applying the Delta Method to calculate standard errors (SE) and coefficient estimates for price and income elasticities. The Delta Method is a powerful technique used to approximate the standard errors of transformed parameters, providing more accurate inference in economic models.
Key Features:
•	Implementation of the Delta Method for estimating standard errors of non-linear functions of parameters.
•	Calculation of coefficient estimates for price and income elasticities.
•	Detailed examples and usage instructions to guide users through the process.
•	Functions and scripts that can be easily integrated into broader econometric analyses.
This repository is designed for economists, statisticians, and researchers who require precise standard error estimates and coefficient (approximate) calculations for elasticity measures. It is particularly useful in empirical economic research where accurate estimation of price and income elasticities is crucial.
