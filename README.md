# R-code-for-Delta-Method
This repository contains R code for applying the Delta Method to calculate standard errors (SE) and coefficient estimates for price and income elasticities. The Delta Method is a powerful technique used to approximate the standard errors of transformed parameters, providing more accurate inference in economic models.
